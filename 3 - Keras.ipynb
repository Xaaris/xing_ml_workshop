    "## Anatomy of a Keras model\n",
    "\n",
    "A Keras model contains the following objects:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Layers, which are combined into a model\n",
    " * The input data and labels\n",
    " * The loss function, which defines the feedback signal used for learning\n",
    " * The optimizer, which determines how learning proceeds\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/keras_model.png\" height=\"250\" width=\"400\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "## Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "A layer is a function that takes as input one or more tensors and that outputs one or more tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some layers are stateless, but more frequently layers have a state: the layerâ€™s weights, one or several tensors learned with stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of stateless layers:\n",
    " * Dropout: regularization to reducing overfitting in models\n",
    " * Merge layers: concatenate, sum, mean, min, max etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of stateful layers:\n",
    " * Dense layers\n",
    " * Recurrent layers\n",
    " * Convolution layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Different layers are appropriate for different types of data processing:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Vector data, stored in 2D tensors of shape (batch_size, features), is usually processed by dense layers\n",
    " * Sequence data, stored in 3D tensors of shape (batch_size, timesteps, features), is usually processed by recurrent layers\n",
    " * Image data, stored in 4D tensors of shape (batch_size, height, width, colors), is usually processed by convolution layers\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of layers as LEGO bricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are built by clipping together compatible layers to form useful data-transformation pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of layer compatibility here refers specifically to the fact that every layer will only accept input tensors of a certain shape and will return output tensors of a certain shape\n",
    "\n",
    "A model is a directed, acyclic graph of layers. The most common instance is a linear stack of layers, mapping a single input to a single output. More complex models will have multiple inputs/outputs or short-cut connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each problem class usually exist one or more standard model architectures. It is always a good idea to start with one of this models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general picking the right model architecture is more an art than a science.\n"
