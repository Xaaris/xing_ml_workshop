    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine learning** uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important distinction is that machine learning is strictly data driven and does not rely on specification and encoding of rules as it is usually done in software engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of machine learning problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is the task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on labeled examples. A labeled example is a pair consisting of an input example and a desired output value. The goal is to learn a function that shows good prediction performance on unseen examples. A common problem is to provide a large enough dataset of labeled examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    " * all classification problems\n",
    " * all regression problems\n",
    " * machine translation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is the task of learning a function that describes the structure of unlabeled data. Unlabeled means that the input examples have not been classified or categorized. Because the examples are unlabeled, there is usually no direct way to evaluate the outcome. The advantage of unsupervised learning is that for many domains the collection of data is very cheap, especially for text, image and video data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    " * word2vec, doc2vec\n",
    " * Generative adverserial networks (GANs)\n",
    " * Autoencoder\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is the task of training a software agent to take actions in an environment. The goal is to maximize some notion of cumulated reward. An examples would be the Atari game Pong where the current screen image is the input, the agent returns a Joystick action (UP, DOWN, NOP) and the reward is the player's score. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in that no labeled examples must be provided. The agent learns from the consequences of its actions and reinforces behavior that has been successful. In many cases RL uses a simulator for the environment to reduce training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    " * Atari games\n",
    " * AlphaGo, AlphaZero\n",
    " * Robotics\n",
    " * Trading strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is the supervised learning problem problem of predicting a continuous quantity output for an example. Its a  supervised problem so labeled examples are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    " * price, volume and volatility prediction for stocks\n",
    " * prediction of energy consumption\n",
    " * page impression prediction\n",
    " * mean time to failure prediction for a machine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification \n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is the supervised learning problem of predicting a discrete label output for an example. Its a  supervised problem so labeled examples are required. If the problems has only two classes its called binary classification, otherwise its called multi-class classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    " * price direction prediction for stocks\n",
    " * image classification, e.g.its a dog or a cat picture\n",
    " * object segmentation, e.g. find all instances of cats on the picture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence-learning problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning problems where examples are ordered sequences of events. Some examples are:\n",
    " * sequence of price changes for a stock\n",
    " * the events a user generates on a website\n",
    " * sequence of moves in a board game\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequence prediction** involves predicting the next value for a given input sequence. Examples:\n",
    " * stock price 1 minute into the future\n",
    " * next most likely word in a sequence of words\n",
    " * next best move in a game of Go\n",
    " \n",
    "**Sequence classification** involves predicting a class label for a given input sequence. Examples:\n",
    " * sequence of moves in a chess game wins the game\n",
    " * generate buy/sell signals for a sequence of stock prices\n",
    " * sentiment analysis\n",
    " * anomaly detection\n",
    " \n",
    "**Sequence to sequence** problems generate an output sequence for an input sequence. Examples:\n",
    " * word tagging: annotate each token from a set of token types\n",
    " * entity extraction: annotate words as persons, organizations, countries etc.\n",
    " * machine translation\n",
    " * text summarization\n"
