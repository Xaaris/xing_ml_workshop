    "\n",
    "**Machine learning** uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important distinction is that machine learning is strictly **data driven** and does not rely on specification and encoding of rules as it is usually done in software engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we commonly understand under ML/AI is only a small part of a bigger process:\n",

    "## Selection of types of machine learning problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is the task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on **labeled examples**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    " * image classification: all images are labeled as 'cat picture', 'dog picture' etc.\n",
    " * appartment rent prediction: each example appartment is labeled with the current rent\n",
    " * machine translation: each english sentence is labeled with the german translation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is the task of learning a function that describes the structure of unlabeled data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    " * word2vec, doc2vec\n",
    " * Generative adverserial networks (GANs)\n",
    " * Autoencoder\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is the task of training a software agent to take actions in an environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in that no labeled examples must be provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "The agent learns from the consequences of its actions and reinforces behavior that has been successful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    " * Atari games\n",
    " * AlphaGo, AlphaZero\n",
    " * Robotics\n",
    " * Trading strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is the supervised learning problem problem of predicting a continuous quantity output for an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its a supervised problem so labeled examples are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    " * price, volume and volatility prediction for stocks\n",
    " * prediction of energy consumption\n",
    " * predict views for an article\n",
    " * mean time to failure prediction for a machine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification \n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is the supervised learning problem of predicting a discrete label output for an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the problems has only two classes its called **binary classification**, otherwise its called **multi-class classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    " * price direction prediction for stocks\n",
    " * image classification, e.g.its a dog or a cat picture\n",
    " * object segmentation, e.g. find all instances of cats on the picture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence-learning problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning problems where examples are **ordered sequences** of events. Some examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    " * sequence of price changes for a stock\n",
    " * the events a user generates on a website\n",
    " * sequence of moves in a board game\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequence prediction** involves predicting the next value for a given input sequence. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    " * stock price 1 minute into the future\n",
    " * next most likely word in a sequence of words\n",
    " * next best move in a game of Go\n",
    " \n",
    "**Sequence classification** involves predicting a class label for a given input sequence. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    " * sequence of moves in a chess game wins the game\n",
    " * generate buy/sell signals for a sequence of stock prices\n",
    " * sentiment analysis\n",
    " * anomaly detection\n",
    " \n",
    "**Sequence to sequence** problems generate an output sequence for an input sequence. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    " * word tagging: annotate each token from a set of token types\n",
    " * entity extraction: annotate words as persons, organizations, countries etc.\n",
    " * machine translation\n",
    " * text summarization\n"
