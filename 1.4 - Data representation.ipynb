A common solution is to convert each document to a fixed size vector, for example by using a TFIDF representation or by using a Doc2Vec algorithm.  The other solution is to represent each word as an integer ID and just put the sequence of word in a vector of fixed size. Shorter documents are padded and longer documents are cut off."
